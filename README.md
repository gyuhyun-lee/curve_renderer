# curve_renderer
Project that I did for the class called 'Surfaces and Curves'.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to make a simple renderer that draws various types of curves(NLI, Bernstein ... ) without any bloatware.

Currently, this project uses : 
- win32 API
- windows OpenGL(wgl)
- stb truetype
